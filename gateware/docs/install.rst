On an Ubuntu system, the following are the main dependencies:

- The build system: install `pdm <https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm>`_
- For synthesis/simulation: install `oss-cad-suite <https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build>`_ (and see note below)
- For any examples that include a softcore: `rust <https://rustup.rs/>`_

  - To build stripped images for RISC-V, you also need:

    .. code-block:: bash

       rustup target add riscv32im-unknown-none-elf
       rustup target add riscv32imafc-unknown-none-elf # for `macro_osc` only, it uses an FPU
       rustup component add rustfmt clippy llvm-tools
       cargo install cargo-binutils svd2rust form

.. note::
    By default, synthesis will use :code:`yowasp-yosys` and :code:`yowasp-nextpnr-ecp5` (python packages), rather than any :code:`oss-cad-suite` you have installed. When running locally, builds are usually faster if you point to your own installation - modify :code:`gateware/.env.toolchain` (simply deleting it will try to find yosys in your PATH).

To set up the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd gateware
   git submodule update --init --recursive

To install all python dependencies in a PDM-managed venv:

.. code-block:: bash

   pdm install


.. note::

    Most examples are built in CI. If you're having trouble setting up your environment, it may also be worth checking the github workflow configuration.
